# stig_converter.py

## Overview and Features

stig_converter converts DISA STIG Checklists into various file formats.
This project is the result of a collection of individual Python scripts used to convert STIGs and is currently being sewn back together into one main script.

Supported file formats:

- convert `.ckl` file to `.csv` file

- convert `.csv` file to `.json` file

- convert `.ckl` file to `.json` file

- convert `.json` file to `.ckl` file

- pull down latest STIGs from www.stigviewer.com and convert them to a markdown format

- send STIGs as splunk events _(coming soon)_

## Usage

1. `git clone https://github.com/iosecurityio/stig_converter.git`

1. `cd stig_converter`

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python stig_converter.py [-h]  -i INPUT.[.ckl|.json|.csv] -o OUTPUT.[.ckl|.json|.csv]`

## TODO

- Refactor redundant code from scripts in stig_converter.py

Inspired by "a Python script to extract data out of a DISA STIG Viewer xccdf file to a CSV" @author Michael Joseph Walsh <github.com@nemonik.com> and the original [Github link](https://gist.github.com/nemonik/951a0e55436e0708222b). Shout out.

> Note: (This was a Python2 implementation that I changed to Python3 and incorporated into `stig_converter.py`)
